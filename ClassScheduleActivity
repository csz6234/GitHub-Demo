# Class Schedule

### STAT 184: Introduction to R Programming

 	
R is a powerful, open-source programming language used widely for applications in statistics and data science. 
It is easily extendible, and thousands of user-created packages are publicly available to extend its capabilities. 
This course will introduce students to data computing fundamentals and a reproducible workflow using the R 
programming language and related tools. Students will be expected to access, join, wrangle, clean, and visualize 
real data from various sources (e.g. CSV, HTML scraping, web URL, R packages). The course will emphasize use of 
"tidyverse" R packages (e.g. dplyr, ggplot2), although students will also be exposed to Base R and other packages.
In addition, students will be exposed to one or more integrated development environments (e.g. RStudio) and will 
be expected to write well-documented code using a reproducible workflow (e.g. RMarkdown, Git/GitHub). The course 
focuses on descriptive and graphical summary techniques rather than inferential statistical techniques 

### CMPSC 221

 	
The course covers advanced object-oriented principles and their application to web-based, net-centric computing.
Major topics include virtual machines, intermediate code generation (Java-specific), graphical user interfaces 
(GUI) design, event handling, server-side programming with database queries, and security, permissions and file 
management concepts for client/server systems. Extensive programming assignments provide an understanding of the
entire process of client/server development including interface prototyping, program design, implementation of 
both client and server programs, unit testing, and documentation. This course prepares students to meet immediate 
demands in solving complex computational problems. 

### STAT 414

STAT 414 / MATH 414 is an introduction to the theory of probability for students in statistics, mathematics, 
engineering, computer science, and related fields. The course presents students with calculus-based probability 
concepts and those concepts can be used to describe the uncertainties present in real applications. Topics include
probability spaces, discrete and continuous random variables, transformations, expectations, generating functions,
conditional distributions, law of large numbers, central limit theorems. Most students are recommended to sequentially 
take MATH 230 or MATH 231 prior to STAT414 / MATH 414, although the alignment of the topics in each class permit
concurrent enrollment. Students may take only one course from STAT 414 / MATH 414 and STAT 418 / MATH 418.
